# PlantDiseaseClassification

#### The project detects the plant diseases and classify its severity accurately using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to facilitate remedial measures well in time to improve production.  

#### The steps to execute the project are as follows:  
1. Have a Google account with minimum 10GB of free space in Google Drive.  
2. Store all the datasets from "PDC_Datasets" folder in a specific folder in the drive.  
3. To run a program from PDC_Code:  
	a. Open the source code, say, "1_Edge_Detection_1.ipynb" in Google Colab.  
	b. Update the dataset path.  
	c. Finally, run the program.  
4. Similarly, run the remaining files from "2_SVM_1.ipynb" to "9_Corn_efficient_1.ipynb" sequentially as numbered in Google Colab.  
5. After successful execution of first 9 files, run "10_Predict_1.ipynb" file. Provide a path of an image as to test the model and obtain the detected disease and severity of the plant.  
6. NOTE: Make sure the paths to all datasets and pickle files generated are updated correctly.
